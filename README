jlist
=================
jlist is my fork of dio, dio is a generic input output program for X. 
It reads list items from stdin. These items can be added or removed, they 
can be grouped and sorted by groups, and be output to stdout singly or as a
whole group at a time. jlist can also generate text for stdout from user input.

The idea behind this is to give a generic interface for editing 

Requirements
------------
In order to build jlist you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (jlist is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dlist (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install
